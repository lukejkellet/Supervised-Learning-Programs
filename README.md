<h1>Supervised Learning Programs</h1>

 ### [Download Project](https://github.com/lukejkellet/Supervised-Learning-Programs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a trio of supervised learning algorithms - Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours Regression, and a Decision Tree. Each of these was developed in Python, and made use of the matplotlib and scikit learn libraries. Each program is coded to output a graph that showcases the weight assigned to different features within a dataset. These supervised learning algorithms were developed and compared as part of my dissertation.
